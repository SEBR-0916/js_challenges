## Overview

To provide additional practice writing JavaScript functions to solve a specific task,  we'll be working on these challenges each morning. Some of these you may see used throughout the course, some you may have already seen in prework and on sites like codewars or leetcode. 

The goal is to practice our JS, build up our repetition of syntax and problem solving, and learn new, more modern and elegant ways of working with the code.


## Practice

Work on one challenge at a time by running "node script.js" inside of your "js_challenges" folder. When you finish each challenge, comment out your code, (or at least just the part where you call the function) so that you are only running one function each time
